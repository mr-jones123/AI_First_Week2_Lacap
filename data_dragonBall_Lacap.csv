His battles against Jiren, Broly, and Moro show his peak potential.","Goku is a Saiyan warrior known for his strength, resilience, and growth. At his peak (Ultra Instinct), his power level is immeasurable but roughly estimated to be >10 nonillion."
3. Why is Vegeta’s character arc important to the Dragon Ball saga?,"Vegeta begins as a villain but becomes a reluctant ally, rival, and eventually a hero. His pride and struggle to surpass Goku define his character. He undergoes emotional development, fighting for his family and justice instead of pure power.","Vegeta’s arc illustrates redemption, pride, and perseverance. At his peak with Ultra Ego form, his power level is comparable to Goku’s Ultra Instinct, also >10 nonillion."
4. How does Frieza remain a central villain despite being defeated multiple times?,"Frieza symbolizes tyranny and resurrection. Even after death, he returns stronger, adapting with new forms like Golden Frieza and Black Frieza. His intellect and ruthlessness make him more dangerous than brute strength alone.","Frieza's evolution shows his tactical growth. In his latest ""Black Frieza"" form, he rivals or even surpasses Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta, with a power level likely >10 nonillion."
5. What makes Beerus a unique character in Dragon Ball Super?,"Beerus is a God of Destruction, introduced to show the vastness of the Dragon Ball multiverse.

6. What role does Jiren play in challenging the philosophy of strength?,"Jiren, from Universe 11, believes in power as justice. He defeats entire universes alone, showing raw strength.

During the Tournament of Power, his power level was likely on par or above Ultra Instinct Goku — >10 nonillion."
7. Why is Broly’s power considered “legendary”?,"Broly is a unique Saiyan with an innate power beyond normal limits. In the 2018 movie, he adapts mid-battle, gaining strength rapidly without training.

In Dragon Ball Super: Broly, his final power is potentially above Goku and Vegeta — estimated >10 nonillion and growing."
8. How does Zamasu/Goku Black reflect the dangers of godly arrogance?,"Zamasu believes mortals corrupt the universe. Using the Super Dragon Balls to become immortal and switch bodies with Goku (Goku Black), he executes the ""Zero Mortals Plan.""

His power level post-fusion is at least 10–50 nonillion, but unstable due to his corrupted body."
"9. Why is Gohan's potential unique, and how is it realized in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero?","Gohan was always said to have latent potential greater than Goku.

11. What is the significance of the Angels (like Whis) in the Dragon Ball multiverse hierarchy?,"Angels are guides to Gods of Destruction and embody balance, neutrality, and infinite skill. Whis, who trains both Goku and Vegeta, is effortlessly superior in power and speed. They exist above the gods in hierarchy and power.",
12. What is the Tournament of Power and what is the prize?,"The Tournament of Power is a multiversal battle royale introduced in Dragon Ball Super. Organized by the Omni-Kings, it brings together fighters from eight of the twelve universes. Each universe selects ten warriors to fight on a collapsing stage, and if all of a universe’s fighters are eliminated, that universe is erased from existence. This high-stakes setup pushes every fighter to their limits. The true nature of the prize is hidden until the end, emphasizing moral choices.","The Tournament of Power is a multiverse survival competition where teams from different universes battle until one remains. The prize for the winning universe is the Super Dragon Balls, which grant any wish without limits.
